Changes to Testing for a Remote Pilot Certificate with a 
Small Aircraft Rating 
 
April 21, 2021, will be the effective date for a revision of 14 CFR part 107 and a new 14 CFR part 89.  
These changes will have a direct effect on airman knowledge testing for a Remote Pilot Certificate with a 
Small Aircraft Rating.  The following testing topics will be placed on the revised Unmanned Aircraft 
General (UAG) airman knowledge test on April 6, 2021: 
• Operations Over People 
• Remote Identification 
• Night Operations 
The new testing topics will not be administered on a separate test, they will be integrated into the 
Unmanned Aircraft General – Small airman knowledge test.  A person who successfully passes the 
Unmanned Aircraft General – Small airman knowledge test on or after April 6, 2021, will meet the 
requirements to exercise the certificate privileges of Night Operations within the boundaries set forth 
in 14 CFR part 107.

• Unmanned Aircraft General Sample Airman Knowledge Test Questions 
• Federal Register Vol. 86, No. 10, Operation of Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Over People 
(Note: All new knowledge test questions were drafted from the rule only, beginning on page 68.) 
• Federal Register Vol. 86, No. 10, Remote Identification of Unmanned Aircraft  
(Note: All new knowledge test questions were drafted from the rule only, beginning on page 116.)

• Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge (FAA-H-8083-25B) Chapter 17: Aeromedical Factors  
(Note:  Applicable information found on pages 22 through 27 (pages 17-22 through 17-27 in full 
version of the handbook).) 
Beginning April 6, 2021, the Unmanned Aircraft Recurrent (UGR) airman knowledge test will no longer 
be offered for knowledge recency.  Any person who holds a Remote Pilot Certificate with a Small Aircraft 
Rating may take recurrent training in place of the UGR airman knowledge test.  This training will be 
available on the FAA Safety Team’s webpage beginning on April 6, 2021.
