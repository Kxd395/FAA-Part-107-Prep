• The information in the table above may be presented in more than one form. 
 
• If the acceptable form(s) of identification (as listed in the table above) does not include valid and current 
proof of the applicant’s physical/residential address, the applicant may utilize their parent’s 
physical/residential address; or the applicant may provide proof of their physical/residential address by 
presenting one of the Acceptable Forms of Applicant Address Verification listed on page 4 of this 
document. Examples of an unacceptable physical/residential address are a post office box, rural route, 
flight school address (unless the applicant resides at the school), or a commercial business/employer 
address. 
 
• In the case of an applicant under the age of 18 who does not possess an acceptable form(s) of 
identification, a parent or legal guardian is required to accompany the applicant, and after presenting 
identification as described in the above table, may attest to the applicant’s identity. 
 
• An applicant, who does not possess a passport, due to asylum status, may present government-issued 
documentation, to an FAA Flight Standards District Office (FSDO), or FAA International Field Office (IFO), 
for approval as an acceptable form of identification, in lieu of a passport. The FSDO or IFO will contact the 
FAA’s Testing Standards Section with notification of approval or disapproval.

Acceptable Forms of Age Verification 
 
• 
An applicant must present state or federal government-issued photo identification as proof they 
are at least the minimum eligibility age required for the requested knowledge test as listed in the 
applicable table of this document and as stated in the applicable portion(s) of 14 CFR Part 61, 
sections (§§) 61.35(a)(3), 61.96(b)(1), 61.103(a)(b), 61.123(a), 61.153(a), 61.183(a), 
61.213(a)(1), 61.305(a)(1); or 14 CFR Part 65, § 65.53(a). 
 
Acceptable Forms of Test / Retest Authorization 
 
• 
Refer to the applicable certification/rating page of this document for specific information on 
acceptable forms of airman knowledge test and retest authorization. 
 
• 
For a test taken on or before January 10, 2020, an applicant no longer possessing an AKTR 
may navigate here for instructions on securing a replacement. 
 
• 
For a test taken on or after January 13, 2020, an applicant no longer possessing an AKTR 
may navigate to the PSI Website to print a duplicate. 
 
Codes for Incorrectly Answered Test Questions 
 
• 
For the knowledge tests listed on pages 5 through 15 of this document: 
 
o Test Codes, NOT highlighted in blue, indicate the corresponding test has Learning 
Statement Codes (LSCs) displayed on the resulting AKTR. Matching the LSCs, printed on 
the AKTR, with the associated Learning Statements, assists in the evaluation of subject areas 
shown to be deficient on the knowledge test. The Learning Statement Reference Guide for 
Airman Knowledge Testing is available here. 
 
o Test Codes, highlighted in blue, indicate the corresponding test has Airman Certification 
Standards (ACS) Codes displayed on the resulting AKTR. Matching the ACS Codes, printed 
on the AKTR, with the associated code descriptions, assists in the evaluation of subject areas 
shown to be deficient on the knowledge test. ACS Codes are displayed ONLY on AKTRs for 
knowledge tests taken after the effective date of the corresponding ACS document. The 
ACS documents are available here. 
 
Validation Questions 
 
• 
Any of the tests, described in this Matrix, may include validation questions, which are questions 
used to accumulate data for statistical analysis of test question validity and performance. 
 
o Validation questions are NOT scored, and do NOT count for or against the applicant’s final 
test score. 
o The listed “NUMBER OF QUESTIONS” does NOT include validation questions. 
o The listed “ALLOTTED TIME” includes the time required to respond to validation 
questions.
