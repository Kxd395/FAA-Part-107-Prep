* **Answer:** An Alert Area.


* **Question:** What type of special use airspace contains areas where flight is prohibited for national security and welfare reasons?
* **Answer:** A Prohibited Area.


* **Question:** Refer to figure 32. The chart shows a gray line with a four-digit route number. Could this area present a hazard to the operations of a small unmanned aircraft?
* **Answer:** Yes, because Military Training Routes (MTRs) with four digits operate at or below 1,500 ft AGL.


* **Question:** What airport is located approximately 47° 9 minutes north latitude and 94° 38 minutes west longitude?
* **Answer:** Walker Mooney.



### Domain 3: Airport Operations & Radio Communications

* **Question:** Refer to figure 54 at Coeur d'Alene airport. Which frequency should be used as a common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF) to monitor airport traffic?
* **Answer:** 122.8 (Identified by the letter 'C' next to the frequency).


* **Question:** An aircraft announces that they are short final of runway 9. Where will the aircraft be in relation to the north?
* **Answer:** The aircraft is landing east, so it is coming from the west.


* **Question:** When approaching holding lines from the side with continuous lines, the pilot should do what?
* **Answer:** Stop and not cross those lines until cleared by the tower.


* **Question:** You're conducting a small UAS operation northeast of a nearby airport. While monitoring CTAF, an aircraft announces that it is departing runway 36 utilizing a right traffic pattern. Will the aircraft conflict with your operation?
* **Answer:** Yes, the aircraft is taking off north and turning east, directly over your operation.



### Domain 4: Weather & Aviation Weather Reports

* **Question:** When operating near clouds, what is the minimum distance a small UAS must maintain?
* **Answer:** 500 ft below the clouds and 2,000 ft horizontally.


* **Question:** Refer to figure 10. What is the visibility of KDEN?
* **Answer:** 1 statute mile.


* **Question:** Refer to figure 11. What winds are reported on the 19th day of the month at 1005 Zulu?
* **Answer:** 240 degrees at 6 knots.


* **Question:** What is the second stage of a thunderstorm?
* **Answer:** The mature stage.


* **Question:** How does high density altitude (hot, humid, high elevation) affect drone performance?
* **Answer:** It decreases performance; the battery life will be less, and motors have to work harder.



### Domain 5: Loading, Performance & Aerodynamics

* **Question:** If a small unmanned aircraft weighs 8 lb in leveled flight, what effective weight does it experience at a 70° bank according to the chart?
* **Answer:** ~23 lbs (8 lbs * 2.923 load factor).


* **Question:** How does a drone with a center of gravity too far forward typically behave in flight?
* **Answer:** It tends to pitch down, requiring the front motors to work harder to keep the drone level and climb.


* **Question:** Increasing the angle of attack will also increase what?
* **Answer:** Lift and drag.


* **Question:** How will a higher drone weight affect stall speed?
* **Answer:** The heavier the drone, the more lift is needed, negatively affecting the overall performance.


* **Question:** What does the term angle of attack refer to?

```
* **Answer:** The angle between the chord line of the wing/propeller blade and the relative wind.

```

### Domain 6: Crew Resource Management & ADM

* **Question:** Which of the following is not one of the FAA's five hazardous attitudes?
* **Answer:** (The five hazardous attitudes to know are: Impulsivity, Invulnerability, Macho, Anti-authority, and Resignation. The test will present a distractor option that isn't one of these).
